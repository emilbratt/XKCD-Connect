This is a work in progress while Im studying.
As a continuation of an assignment, I figured I would keep working on this project.
The assignment involved scraping XKCD.com for content. Im using tools and ideas from what Ive learned so far.

INSTRUCTION:
Install Python and run.

Only tested on Fedora 32, but should work on all major platforms.
